    "In this step, you will use the [Stock Quote API](https://finnhub.io/docs/api#quote) to get a stock quote for a company. Write a function named `quote` that takes one string parameter, a stock ticker symbol. Your function should use the Finnhub API to get a quote for the given ticker. It should then return a Python dictionary having the following format:\n",

Similarly, the value of the `close` key should be the stock's closing price as a float. The value of the `movement` key should be the string `'UP'` if the stock closed higher than it opened, `'DOWN'` if the stock closed lower than it opened, or `'FLAT'` if the stock closed at the opening price."
